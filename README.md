# sportProgramming

This repository is where I track my coding challenge practice in a more structured way. It belongs to the Codewars GitHub organization, but instead of creating a new repo for every problem, I now keep everything organized here — grouped by topic.

This structure makes it easier to revisit similar problems, recognize patterns, and improve over time.

🗂️ Note: My previous challenge solutions remain under the Codewars GitHub organization as individual repositories. Going forward, I will be posting new challenges in this centralized repo.

## Purpose

I use this repo to:
- Practice coding challenges efficiently
- Organize solutions by topic for easier review
- Avoid creating dozens of separate repositories

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a topic or category of problems:

```
sportProgramming/
├── arrays/
├── linkedLists/
├── stacks/
├── strings/
```


## 🚀 Workflow

1. Pick a problem from a platform like Codewars, LeetCode, or HackerRank.
2. Solve it locally.
3. Save it inside the matching topic folder (e.g., `arrays/`, `strings/`).


## 💬 Notes

- I write solutions mostly in Python and JS.
